# Homebrew

Using macOS? Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/ "Link to Homebrew website") for an easy way to manage installed applications and services.

## Installation

Paste the below prompt into your macOS Terminal:

``` bash
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

> If you want the latest version of `curl` rather than the default on macOS, run `brew install curl` after installing Homebrew.

## Casks and Formulae

Below are a list of casks (applications and services) that I install via Homebrew.

### Casks

``` bash
$ brew install appcleaner
$ brew install discord
$ brew install handbrake
$ brew install iterm2
$ brew install raycast
$ brew install the-unarchiver
$ brew install vlc
```

### Formulae

``` bash
$ brew install gh
$ brew install rbenv
```
