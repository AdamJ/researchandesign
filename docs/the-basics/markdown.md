# Markdown

You know it, you love it - Markdown. A text-to-HTML conversion tool for writing on the web. If you don't know what Markdown is, you can read about it [here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "Link to Daring Fireball writeup on Markdown").

## Usage

I use Markdown for almost all of the document writing, usually in conjunction with VSCode and the markdownlint and Markdown Table extensions. Markdown has everything I _usually_ need, such as Headings `<h1>`, Paragraphs `<p>`, Links `<a>`, Images `<img>`, and Tables `<table>`. I chose Docusaurus (as well as 11ty for my portfolio site) due to their support for Markdown.

Customizing Markdown, when output to the web, can be done using a simple CSS file and basic classes that target the HTML elements for the rendered text.

Outside of the standard Markdown methods, I tend to follow the syntax as documented on [Daring Fireball / Markdown / Syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax "Link to Daring Fireball Markdown syntax outline"), specifically the `atx` style.

> Another useful guide is that from Google's [style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/docguide/style.html "Link to Google's Markdown style guide").
